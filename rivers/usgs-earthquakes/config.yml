# Short text description of the data you are providing.
description: GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. A GeoJSON object may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features. GeoJSON uses the JSON standard. The GeoJSONP feed uses the same JSON response, but the GeoJSONP response is wrapped inside the function call, eqfeed_callback. See the GeoJSON site for more information.
